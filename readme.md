University Portal â€“ Dynamic DOM Project
Overview

This project was developed during my second year of studies as part of a web development module. The goal was to build a university course portal using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, with a strong focus on Dynamic DOM querying, event handling, and runtime element creation.

The portal allows users to:

Browse available courses.

View course details such as description and duration.

See deadlines for course sign-ups.

Interact with dynamically generated elements based on user input and events.

This project highlights my ability to build interactive web applications without relying on external frameworks.

Features

Dynamic DOM manipulation for adding, removing, and updating elements.

Event-driven design for responsive user interaction.

Data collection and display through JavaScript functions.

Simple and intuitive interface for exploring courses.

Technologies Used

HTML

CSS

JavaScript (DOM manipulation and event handling)

Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I gained practical experience in:

Working with the Document Object Model (DOM).

Writing clean, modular JavaScript code for interactivity.

Designing responsive interactions without frameworks.

Understanding how event-driven programming improves user experience.

How to Run

Clone the repository.

Open the index.html file in your browser.

Interact with the portal to browse courses and test the dynamic features.

Future Improvements

If extended, this project could include:

Persistent data storage (e.g., local storage or database).

Authentication for students and lecturers.

A back-end to manage course information dynamically.
